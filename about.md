I'm currently a research assistant professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Here, I'll probably mostly blog about intuitions I've found for mathematical concepts that aren't _quite_ present in any of the other things I've read on the internet.

### More Information

You probably can find out what I'm currently up to by checking my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ozcJ9zYAAAAJ).
